=== Firefox Improvements

* SelectList#set is now defined for Firefox. Like with IE, it is an alias for

* Element collections are now enumerable. This allows methods such as @select@
  and @map@ to be used with methods such as @divs@ and @links@.
* FireWatir.attach is now available, analogous to IE.attach.
* Some Javascript errors that were being ignored, now raise Ruby exceptions.
* Added event handler which resets the context of document 
* Fix bug that occurred when new page was automatically loaded. (Angrez, 3ef8b6)
  when page gets loaded automatically (Angrez)
* Changed code to use document_var, body_var, window_var, browser_var instead of 
  "document", "body", "window", "browser" variables. (Angrez)
* Changed code to replace every quote (") in xpath query with (\") so that it 
  doesn't give error while executing the xpath query (Angrez)
* Fire onchange event for FireWatir file fields. Closes WTR-286. (Jarib)
* Fixes for running and closing Firefox on Mac OS X
* added functionality to allow Watir::Browser.attach with no arguments to open 
 a new firefox window rather than taking over the existing focused window (Rob Aldred)
* also modified some setup functions to correctly handle closed browsers, 
 browserless windows and others (Rob Aldred)
* Add test and implementation for Firefox#status http://jira.openqa.org/browse/WTR-250 (Jarib)
* 2 problems fixed with .click (jubishop)
  a) When chaining together element calls the @container becomes an 
     HTMLElement, but there's no container_var defined for HTMLElement
  b) When an <a tag has no href then element_type was returning nil.

=== IE Improvements

    IE.set_options :attach_timeout => 5.0
  This was previously available as class method.

* Fix for Browser#execute_script on IE7. (Jarib)
* Removed ActiveSupport dependency. (Jarib)

  dead code, renaming variables, and simplifying code. Also a few performance
  improvements.
* Rename source file names for consistency.
  
=== Unit Tests

* Add tests demonstrating known bugs.
* Make the "window" tests run more reliably.
* Relocate unreliable tests.
* Tag tests that are known to fail on IE or Firefox.

  Use xls transform to format results.
